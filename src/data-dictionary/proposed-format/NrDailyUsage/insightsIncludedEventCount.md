Count of all events of the given insightsEventNamespace stored for the retention period included with a paid non-Insights product subscription.

For example, APM Pro subscriptions include several days' retention of Transaction events. This attribute represents a count of events existing in storage as measured on a given day, and not a count of the events added to storage during a given day. Summing this attribute over a period of more than a day may not give you what you expect; for example, it will not yield the total volume of events written to storage in that period.
